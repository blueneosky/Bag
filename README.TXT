Contains various project pop out of my mind for my needs

Not finished (probably never for most of them)
Can be sandbox or academic coding tests

Take what you want (or what you can) ^_^

NB1 : can be coded in french, sorry I'm french, or (ugliest) in frenglish when I needed to convert a project from a language to an other...
NB2 : all code is for me, not for you, don't expect any support or bug fixes (except if my work is affected)
