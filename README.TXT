Contains various projects poped out of my mind, for my needs

Not finished (probably never will for most of them)
Can be sandbox or academic coding tests

Take what you want (or what you can) ^_^

NB1 : can be coded in french, sorry I'm french, or (ugliest) in frenglish when I needed to convert a project from a language to an other...
NB2 : the whole code was designed for my needs, don't expect any support or bug fixes (except if my work is affected)
